# DataPrep Cleaning APIs

## Roadmap

### End of Summer 2020

Yi and Brandon:
* implement one API each
* edit the API explanation ipynb files (particularly the first APIs for the new members) if needed to clarify the requirements or add ideas for implementation (e.g., if we learn any lessons from our own implementation)
* add real world messy datasets or links to messy datasets to the datasets folder

### Fall 2020

Get DataPrep's Data Cleaning component off to a strong start by implementing a few APIs with high quality, thoroughly tested, and well structured code.

#### Planned APIs to implment

The first four are the team's starting task and the rest are in order of importance

1. `clean_text()`
2. `clean_email()`
3. `clean_url()`
4. `clean_ml()`
5. `clean_date()`
6. `clean_address()`
7. `clean_country()`
8. `clean_phone()`
9. `clean_lat_long()`
10. `clean_ip()`
11. `clean_currency()`

### Spring 2020

* Implement more APIs
* Consider domain specific cleaning scenarios (e.g., finance, biology)
* Marketing: blog post and videos


## Tentative starting tasks

Preliminary: Should we ask each team member to make a small change (e.g., fix a bug, add a small additional feature) to one of the implemented APIs to become familiar with the code?

### Tentative first functions:

* Alice: `clean_text()` (3 weeks)
* Ryan: `clean_email()` (3 weeks)
* Peter: `clean_url()` (3 weeks)
* Danrui: `clean_ml()` (3 weeks)
